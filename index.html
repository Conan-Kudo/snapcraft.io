                <h2>How do Snaps work?</h2>
                <p>A Snap is a fancy zip file containing an application together
                with its dependencies, and a description of how it should safely
                be run on your system, especially the different ways it should
                talk to other software.</p>
                <p>Most importantly Snaps are designed to be secure, sandboxed,
                containerised applications isolated from the underlying system
                and from other applications. Snaps allow the safe installation
                of apps from any vendor on mission critical devices and desktops.</p>

                <p>Try this (you may need to <a href="#responsive-tabs">install snapd</a>)</p>

                <pre class="command-line">
<code>$ sudo snap install hello-world</code></pre>

                <p>Now you have installed a Snap. You can take a look inside the
                Snap very easily, it shows up as a new directory on your system:</p>

                <pre class="command-line">
<code>$ cd /snap/hello-world/current/

$ tree
.
├── bin                 ← this directory structure is just for convenience
│   ├── echo               there is no hardcoded structure requirement other
│   ├── env                than meta/snap.yaml
│   ├── evil
│   ├── sh
│   ├── showdev
│   └── usehw
└── meta                 ← your snap must have this directory
    ├── icon.png         ← no prizes for guessing what this is
    └── snap.yaml        ← this is the required metadata</code></pre>

                <p>So a Snap is very easy to create. Just put all the files you need
                into a directory, use whatever subdirectory structure you want. That
                directory will be compressed into a squashfs - a zipped directory -
                and then it will be mounted at /snap/&lt;name&gt;/current when the Snap is
                installed. Your Snap apps will know where they are mounted because
                that is provided as the $SNAP environment variable when Snap apps
                are run.</p>

                <p>The only actual hard requirement on a Snap structure is that you
                have a file called meta/snap.yaml inside your Snap directory, which
                describes security requirements and how the Snap should be integrated
                with other parts of the system. Let’s take a look at that snap.yaml
                for the hello-world Snap:</p>

                <pre class="command-line">
<code>$ cat meta/snap.yaml
name: hello-world
version: 6.1
architectures: [ all ]
summary: "The 'hello-world' of snaps"
description: |
    This is a simple Snap example that includes a few interesting binaries
    to demonstrate Snaps and their confinement.
    * hello-world.env  - dump the env of commands run inside app sandbox
    * hello-world.evil - show how snappy sandboxes binaries
    * hello-world.sh   - enter interactive shell that runs in app sandbox
    * hello-world      - simply output text
apps:
 env:
   command: bin/env
 evil:
   command: bin/evil
 sh:
   command: bin/sh
 hello-world:
   command: bin/echo</code></pre>

                <p>The top metadata is easy, that’s just descriptive. One thing to
                remember is that the version is purely for humans, the Snap system
                won’t ever treat that version as special or try to compare versions
                between Snaps. That’s just so you know what the developer thinks about
                this software.</p>

                <p>Note the explicit list of “apps” exported by this Snap. Each app
                is explicitly named (‘env’, ‘evil’, ‘sh’, and ‘hello-world’) and each
                gets a distinctive command, which is path relative to $SNAP. The name
                of the app doesn’t have to match the command.</p>
                <p>The special app here is ‘hello-world’, because it has the same name
                as the Snap itself, it’s the default app in the Snap and you can run
                it just by typing ‘hello-world’ after the Snap is installed. The others
                need to be namespaces, so ‘hello-world.evil’ will execute the bin/evil
                command in the Snap.</p>
                <p>A Snap can declare daemons to be started as well, this one just
                describes some apps.</p>

                <h2>Snaps are read-only and have segregated data stores</h2>
                <p>Snaps are read-only for security. We want to prevent a hostile
                party from sneakily changing the software on your machine, so you
                cannot modify a Snap that is installed on your system. This also
                means you can always check the signature on the Snap, even long
                after you installed it, to make sure it is still exactly the
                software you intended. If you want to modify a Snap, you can
                usually build your own version of it, especially if it is open
                source.</p>
                <p>So where can a Snap write data? Each Snap gets its own set of
                writable directories which have specific properties. There are
                two directories which the Snap can write to independent of the
                user. One of these is versioned - each time the Snap is upgraded
                the data is saved and the new Snap revision can upgrade its copy.
                The other ‘common’ data directory is not versioned and is used
                for big blobs of data that you don’t want to duplicate across
                revisions of the Snap:</p>

                <pre class="command-line">
<code>/var/snap/<name>/current/  ← $SNAP_DATA is the versioned Snap data directory
/var/snap/<name>/common/   ← $SNAP_COMMON will not be versioned on upgrades</code></pre>

                <p>Typically, configuration is stored in one of these, along with
                system-wide data for the Snap.</p>

                <p>There are also an equivalent two writable directories for each
                Snap in the user home, which can be used to store Snap data that
                is specific to one user or another, separately:</p>

                <pre class="command-line">
<code>~/snap/<name>/current/      ← $SNAP_USER_DATA that can be rolled back
~/snap/<name>/common/       ← $SNAP_USER_COMMON unversioned user-specific data</code></pre>

                <p>This way applications can be immutable for security reasons
                while still offering a full and rich user experience. To learn
                more about the makeup of a Snap please see the

                <h3>Snap integration with interfaces, plugs and slots</h3>
                <p> Snaps are safely confined in their separate sandboxes by
                sophisticated kernel security mechanisms. That means that Snaps
                can’t peek around at your data - other than the data you give
                them - if they are compromised. But what if you need your Snap
                to talk to another one? For example, what if your Snap needs to
                talk to a database? That’s where Snaps get really amazing.</p>
                <p>They can use ‘interfaces’ - standard and well-defined ways to
                provide and consume services from one another. Snaps can offer
                ‘slots’ to provide services, and declare ‘plugs’ that connect
                to other Snap slots to consume those services. Imagine two Snaps
                A and B that need to talk to each other:</p>

                <p class="diagram">
                    <img src="{{ site.asset_path }}4d5afbf9-Snapcraft-Interfaces-plugs-and-slots.svg" />
                </p>
                <p><b>These two Snaps can be connected becuase they have a <em>plug</em>
                and a <em>slot</em> with a matching <em>interface</em></b></p>

                <p>There are <a class="external" href="http://ubuntudesign.github.io/docs-demo/snappy-dev/interfaces_list/">
                many interfaces that are defined</a> and can be used by
                Snap developers to describe the ways their Snaps should be
                connected. Also, a Snap can be connected to the host system OS
                using plugs, too, which is how a Snap can access shared user
                documents or other services like OpenGL.</p>

                <p>The interfaces are declared in the snap.yaml metadata:</p>
                <p class="diagram">
                    <img src="{{ site.asset_path }}ac7a226c-Snapcraft%28dot%29io+-+YAML+metadata.svg" />
                </p>

                <p>Snaps can share files with other Snaps from the same vendor,
                or with community-maintained shared Snaps which act as libraries
                of common data or code, using the content-sharing interface, for
                example. This reduces duplication while still ensuring rigorous
                security and update control.</p>

                <p>When you install a Snap, the system will automatically connect
                up the standard, safe plugs and slots. For example, your new game
                will automatically get access to the OpenGL libraries on your
                system because that’s considered normal behaviour for a game.
                But there may be other plugs and slots you can connect up by
                choice, and  Snaps will document those individually.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="eight-col">
                <h3>The architecture of a Snappy system</h3>
                <p>So a Snappy system has a collection of Snaps, each of which
                is read-only, each of which has its own set of independent
                writable directories, and each of which can talk to other Snaps
                and the host OS through a set of plugs and slots with matching
                interfaces. It’s a very elegant world.</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="{{ site.asset_path }}e635d3b2-Snapcraft%28dot%29io+-+Architecture.svg" />
                </p>

                <p>The Snap system will present all the Snap apps under /snap/bin/
                so with that on your $PATH you can easily run Snap commands. It
                will also integrate all the Snap daemons (services) with your
                init system so that they are automatically started and stopped
                as needed.</p>

                <h2>Using Snaps - the Snappy "hello world" tour</h2>
                <p>To install a Snap, you’ll start by looking for available Snaps.
                Anybody can publish a Snap, but if you search the default Ubuntu
                store you will only see Snaps that have been reviewed and judged
                to be of good quality, and which can be installed securely. We
                call these the ‘promoted’ Snaps, and you can search them for a
                matching name:</p>



<pre class="command-line"><code>$ snap find hello
Name         Version  Developer  Notes  Summary
hello        2.10     canonical  -      GNU Hello, the "hello world" Snap
hello-huge   1.0      noise      -      A really big Snap
hello-world  6.1      canonical  -      Hello world example</code></pre>

                <p>You can expand the search to include Snap descriptions with
                --broad if you don’t find what you’re looking for just based on
                the name.</p>

                <p>These examples use the Ubuntu store, your Snap implementation
                might be different, other stores are available and it is also easy
                to create your own. There is an open source
                <a class="external" href="https://github.com/noise/snapstore">simple Snap store</a>
                implementation to get you started making your own store.</p>

                <p>We’ll start by installing GNU Hello, from the Free Software Foundation:</p>

                <pre class="command-line"><code>$ sudo snap install hello</code></pre>

                <p>Just like any other app, we can then launch the Snap  from the
                command line, or from the desktop if it has a launcher:</p>


<pre class="command-line"><code>$ hello
Hello, world!</code></pre>

                <p>See the Snaps installed on your system with ‘snap list’, which
                will also tell you the software version, the unique revision, the
                developer of the installed Snap, and any extra information such
                as whether the Snap is in developer mode or not:</p>


<pre class="command-line"><code>$ snap list
Name     Version   Rev     Developer     Notes
hello    2.10      26      canonical     -
core     16.04-55  109     canonical     -
snapweb  0.17      21      canonical     -</code></pre>
            </div>
            <div class="eight-col">
                <h3>Always fresh – update fast and reliably</h3>
                <p>Snaps are updated automatically in the background every day.
                You can manually get the latest version of all your Snaps with
                'snap refresh' which will bring you completely up to date for all
                Snaps, unless you specify particular Snaps to refresh.</p>


<pre class="command-line"><code>$ sudo snap refresh krita
krita already up to date
$ sudo snap refresh
core updated
hello 64.75 MB [=====================================>___]   12s</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div class="eight-col">
                <h3>And revert if something goes wrong!</h3>
                <p>With the technology built in to Snappy it is simple to roll
                back to a previous version of an application for any reason.</p>


<pre class="command-line"><code>$ snap list
 Name              Version               Rev  Developer  Notes
 hello-world       6.1                   26   canonical  -

 $ sudo snap revert hello-world
 Name             Version                Rev  Developer  Notes
 hello-world      6.0                    25   canonical  -</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div class="eight-col">
                <h3>Stable, candidate, beta and edge channels</h3>
                <p>Developers can release stable, candidate, beta and edge versions
                of a Snap, at the same time, to engage with a community who are
                willing to test upcoming changes. You decide how close to the
                leading edge you want to be.</p>

                <p>By default, Snaps are installed from the stable channel. By convention,
                developers use the ‘candidate’ channel to provide a heads-up of
                a new stable revision, putting it in ‘candidate’ a few days before
                ‘stable’ so that people can test it out. The beta channel is for
                unfinished but interesting milestones, and the edge channel is
                conventionally used for regular or daily development builds that
                have passed some lightweight smoke-testing.</p>


<pre class="command-line"><code>$ sudo snap refresh hello --channel=beta
hello (beta) 1.2 installed</code></pre>

                <p>Now, you can run the beta version of the Snap:</p>


<pre class="command-line"><code>$ hello
Hello, snap padawan!</code></pre>

                <p>You can also install a Snap from the beta channel directly, with:</p>


<pre class="command-line"><code>$ sudo snap install hello --beta
Hello (beta) 1.2 installed</code></pre>
